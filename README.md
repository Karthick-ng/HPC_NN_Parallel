# Neural Network Parallel Implementation

This repository contains the sequential and OpenMP parallel implementations of a Neural Network. For detailed information, please refer to the file [Report_Parallelism_FF_Neural Networks.pdf](Report_Parallelism_FF_Neural%20Networks.pdf).

## Overview

The repository consists of two main implementations:

1. **Sequential Implementation**: This implementation follows a traditional sequential execution approach.
2. **OpenMP Parallel Implementation**: Utilizes OpenMP directives for parallel execution, enhancing performance by leveraging multi-threading capabilities.

## Features

- **Neural Network Framework**: Provides classes for defining neural network layers and the overall network architecture.
- **Parallel Execution**: Utilizes OpenMP directives to parallelize computation, speeding up training and inference processes.
- **Detailed Report**: Refer to [Report_Parallelism_FF_Neural Networks.pdf](Report_Parallelism_FF_Neural%20Networks.pdf) for comprehensive information on parallelization strategies and performance analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Run the executable:
